    "Buffon's Needle Problem was first proposed by Georges Buffon in 1737. By randomly throwing needles onto a hard floor marked with equally spaced lines, Buffon was able to derive a mathematial expression which could be used to calculate the value of pi. Specifically, the probability that a needle of length equal to the width of parallel boards overlaps with a board edge is $\\frac{2}{\\pi}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "One can estimate pi by dropping a large number of pins and using the ratio of overlaps to non-overlaps to estimate pi.\n",
    "The accuracy of this experimental value of pi increases with an increasing number of random throws. \n",
