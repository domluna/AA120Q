    The Advisory provides the pilot with information on the vertical speed or pitch
    angle to fly or avoid to resolve an encounter.

    The climb rate must be between ±4400 feet per minute
    Setting the climb rate to NaN is equivalent to having no Advisory

    The simulated pilot will begin following the advisory exactly at t ∼ U(0, pilot_delay)
